# Syllable Game

Mobile design game meant for play on a single phone.

## Rules

Pretty straight forward. Form a circle with all players.

There are two teams. Every other person is on the same team.

The 'active' player is the person giving 'hints'. The person to their left is holding the phone and assigning points accordingly.

The 'active' player has 60 seconds to get their team to get as many points as possible. 

Two phrases appear. The easier phrase is only worth 1 point, the harder phrase is worth 3 points. 

The 'active' player can only give 1 syllable hints, and they cannot use any words that are a part of the two phrases.

If the 'active' player violates the hint rules, OR decides to skip the phrases, they lose 1 point.

Once the 60 seconds is over, the phone gets passed to the left.

Players can quit any time they want to, and this works for any number of players, 2+.
